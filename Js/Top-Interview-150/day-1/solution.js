/*
Example 1:

    Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
    Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
    Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
    The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.
   
Example 2:

    Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
    Output: [1]
    Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
    The result of the merge is [1].

Example 3:

    Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
    Output: [1]
    Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
    The result of the merge is [1].
    Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.
