/*
Example 1:

    Input: nums = [1,1,2]
    Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
    Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
    It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
Example 2:

    Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
    Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
    Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
    It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
