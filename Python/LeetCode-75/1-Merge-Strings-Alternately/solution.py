Example 1:

    Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
    Output: "apbqcr"
    Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
    word1:  a   b   c
    word2:    p   q   r
    merged: a p b q c r
Example 2:

    Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
    Output: "apbqrs"
    Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
    word1:  a   b 
    word2:    p   q   r   s
    merged: a p b q   r   s
Example 3:

    Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
    Output: "apbqcd"
    Explanation: Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.
    word1:  a   b   c   d
    word2:    p   q 
    merged: a p b q c   d
